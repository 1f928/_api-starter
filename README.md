Nodal API
---
---
My goal with this project is to create a fairly simple & flexible API for use in
any nodal front-end projects. I want to create an API that is able to change if
needed, but has a solid foundation to avoid expensive reworks and remodeling of
existing data. I'd like for the data that I put into the system to make sense in
any potential future nodal application. I understand this is not fully possible,
as I might come across a model which works much better in the future. But I will
try here.
