API Starter
--

Boilerplate code for ExpressJS API - probs not the most robust, but I'll update
it as I go.

Notes:
--
- I've left the `.env` file out of `.gitignore` for now, as this is meant to
  be a setup project, and that includes developer environment. Whenever this
    project is cloned for the sake of creating an API, should probs add it to
  the `.gitignore`.
