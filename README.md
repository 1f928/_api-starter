API Starter
--

Boilerplate code for ExpressJS API - probs not the most robust, but I'll update
it as I go.

Notes:
--
- I've left the `.env` file out of `.gitignore` for now, as this is meant to
  be a setup project, and that includes developer environment. Whenever this
  project is cloned for the sake of creating an API, should probs add it to
  the `.gitignore`.
- Should only require changing the content of `.env`, `package.json`, and
  then adding any routes and business logic specific to the API. I'll get
  to external service (db, etc.) integrations when I get to them :).
