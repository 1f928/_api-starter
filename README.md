API Starter
--

Boilerplate code for ExpressJS API - probs not the most robust, but I'll update
it as I go.

---

Notes:
--
- I've left the `.env` file out of `.gitignore` for now, as this is meant to
  be a setup project, and that includes developer environment. Whenever this
  project is cloned for the sake of creating an API, should probs add it to
  the `.gitignore`.
- Things to change: `package.json` (project name, etc.), `Dockerfile` (workdir
  name), `.env` (APP_NAME), set action secrets in repo settings on GitHub, add
  routes & business logic, etc.
